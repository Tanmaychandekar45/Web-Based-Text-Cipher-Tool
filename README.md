🔐 C++ Full-Stack Caesar Cipher ToolThis repository contains a full-stack web application that allows users to perform Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption via a web interface. The project demonstrates the successful integration of a high-performance C++ backend with a modern JavaScript frontend using a RESTful API structure.The original core logic, based on a simple character-shifting console application, has been migrated to a web server to create an interactive tool.🌟 Key FeaturesCore Logic in C++: The encryption and decryption algorithms are handled by a high-performance C++ backend, utilizing the speed and efficiency of compiled code.Full-Stack Architecture: Separates the presentation layer (HTML/CSS/JS) from the business logic (C++ server).ShutterstockWeb API (Crow Framework): Uses the lightweight Crow C++ Web Framework to set up dedicated API endpoints (/process) for receiving user data and returning encrypted/decrypted results in JSON format.Interactive Frontend: A clean, dark-themed user interface built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that handles user input and dynamically displays the cipher results using the fetch API.🛠️ Technology StackComponentTechnologyRoleBackend/ServerC++ (C++17/C++20)Executes core cipher logic (encryptLogic/decryptLogic).Web FrameworkCrow C++Handles HTTP routing, JSON parsing, and serving static files/templates.Networking DependencyAsio (Standalone)Provides asynchronous networking capabilities for the Crow framework.FrontendHTML5, CSS3, JavaScriptProvides the user interface and manages API communication.🚀 Getting StartedThese instructions will guide you through setting up and running the project locally.PrerequisitesYou need a C++ compiler (like GCC or Clang) that supports C++17 or newer.C++ Compiler: Ensure g++ is installed and accessible in your terminal.External Libraries: You must have the crow_all.h header and the asio_lib folder (containing the standalone Asio headers) in the project root directory for compilation.Project StructurePlaintextCipherProject/

Build and RunNavigate to the project root directory (CipherProject) in your terminal.Compile the C++ code using the appropriate command for your operating system:Bash# For Linux / macOS / WSL
g++ main.cpp -o cipher_app -I./asio_lib -lpthread

# For Windows (MinGW/g++) - requires networking libraries
# g++ main.cpp -o cipher_app.exe -I./asio_lib -lws2_32 -lmswsock
Execute the server:Bash./cipher_app
The console will confirm the server is running on port 18080.Access the application: Open your web browser and navigate to:http://localhost:18080🧪 TestingTo confirm the cipher is working correctly, perform the Reversibility Test:Encrypt: Enter text (e.g., "test") and a key (e.g., 3). Click Encrypt.Decrypt: Take the resulting ciphertext and enter it back into the text area. Use the same key (3). Click Decrypt.Verification: The output must be the original text ("test<img width="3999" height="2615" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/612c8373-5eff-4275-8303-3de0e653c6f6" />
